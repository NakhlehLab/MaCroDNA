# Resampling and stability analyses on Barretts' esophagus data set

For all the following experiments, we prepared the inputs according to the instructions that we described in [here](../../BE_data_analysis/README.md).

## Random assignment test for BE biopsies
In this experiment, we randomly assigned the scRNA-seq cells to scDNA-seq cells in each biopsy. For each biopsy, we repeated the random assignment for 100 million times.

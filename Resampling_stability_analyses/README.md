# Instructions for reproducing the results of our resampling and stability analyses

We performed several resampling and stability analyses on two biological data sets namely, the Barretts' esophagus data set originally introduced in:

> Busslinger, Georg A., et al. "Molecular characterization of Barrettâ€™s esophagus at single-cell resolution." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118.47 (2021): e2113061118.

and the colorectal cancer data from:

> Bian, Shuhui, et al. "Single-cell multiomics sequencing and analyses of human colorectal cancer." Science 362.6418 (2018): 1060-1063.

The instructions and scripts for reproducing the results on the Barretts' esophagus data set are provided in the subdirectory [BE_data_analyses](./BE_data_analyses). To see the instructions and scripts for reproducing the results on the colorectal cancer data set, please visit the subdirectoy [CRC_data_analyses](./CRC_data_analyses).
